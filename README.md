# Cloud Computing : CI/CD Workflows

This repository currently contains code files from an extremely simplistic fighting simulator created when the owner of this repository was still learning to program in Python.

This repository should be configured to automatically run the driver.py and test.py files in the src folder every time anything is pushed. It should also, ostensibly, run manually through use of the Actions tab.

The requirements.txt file is very bare-bones because the code itself is bare-bones.
