# Cloud Computing : CI/CD Workflows

This repository currently contains code files from an extremely simplistic fighting simulator created when the owner of this repository was still learning to program in Python.

This repository should be configured to automatically run the test.py files in the src folder every time anything is pushed. It should also, ostensibly, run manually through use of the Actions tab.

The requirements.txt file is very bare-bones because the code itself is bare-bones. 

I believe that in order to include the driver.py file in the workflow, I would have to change some of my code, which is currently in place. I will work on it (or replace it with alternate code). (Don't judge me too hard for the number of failures.)


Sources consulted while trying to figure this out largely include the following although I did Google several other things that did not help or work:
